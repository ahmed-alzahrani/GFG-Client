#  Goals For Good

## What to fix:

- Email text field expands upon typing on LoggedInView

- Change routing of UPS calls through the server the same as with getting the players

- Allow Arbitrary Loads is on to allow for straight HTTP, this is too vulnerable for Apple

- When failures occur and are logged for debugging (ie: when a user tries to create account and an account already exists) the user also needs to be notified on the UI
